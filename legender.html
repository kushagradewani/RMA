      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In India, the Toyota Fortuner Legender completely changed the luxury SUV market.
        The Legender 4X2 diesel variant was first launched with the new Toyota Fortuner in
        January 2021. However, Toyota introduced the more potent Fortuner Legender model with a
        new style, more amenities, and improved ride quality in India in October of the same year.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has many upgrades and a unique design in addition to a 2.8-liter, BS6-compliant DOHC
        diesel engine with 201PS of power and a potent 500 NM of torque. Over the Fortuner basic,
        the top-end has some stylistic upgrades and more equipment. The Toyota Fortuner Legender
        is now offered in both 4x2 and 4x4 drive systems, thanks to the new variation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are all the details you need to know about the Toyota Fortuner Legender
        if you're planning to purchase it.
      </p>
      <h2>Fortune Legender Variants</h2>
      <h5>Fortuner Legender petrol manual and automatic Variants</h5>
      <p>
        The 2.7-liter petrol engine that powers the Toyota Fortuner's petrol model generates
        166 horsepower and 245 Nm of torque. This engine is available with a 6-speed automatic
        or a 5-speed manual transmission. However, front-wheel drive is the only
        option for the petrol variants.
      </p>
      <h5>Toyota Legender diesel manual and automatic variants</h5>
      <p>
        The 2.8L diesel engine has also been kept, although with some modifications. Combined
        with the 6-speed manual transmission, it generates 177 horsepower and 420 Nm of maximum
        torque. If you choose the automatic-diesel model, the 2.8L engine has undergone a significant
        upgrade and now generates 204hp and a strong 500 Nm of torque with the 6-speed torque converter.
        Both front-wheel drive and four-wheel drive versions of the diesel engine are offered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another Toyota Fortuner model with a completely distinct appearance is the Fortuner Legender
        4x2 AT diesel. It has a split grille that is blacked out and a bumper that is wholly unique
        and looks much sportier. However, there is only one diesel version with a 4x2 drivetrain and
        an automated gearbox.
      </p>
      <h2>Toyota Fortune Legender specifications</h2>
      <p>
        Toyota Fortuner Legender is only available in diesel engines. The 2755 cc Diesel engine generates
        a power of 201.15bhp at 3000-3400rpm and a torque of 500Nm at 1600-2800rpm. Interestingly,
        despite mild vibrations during startup, the engine barely makes any noise within the cabin.
      </p>
      <p>
        In configurations, Toyota Fortuner measures 4795mm in length, 1855mm in width,
        1835mm in height, and 2745mm in wheelbase.
      </p>
      <p>

        with a certified mileage of 12.92 Kmpl as per ARAI.
      </p>
      <h2>Interiors</h2>
      <p>
        The Toyota Legender has a seating capacity of 7. With excellent support under the thighs,
        these chairs allow for extended hours over vast distances. They also provide enough headroom
        and knee room. There are two glove boxes, door bins, a center console, and other storage areas,
        which can all be used to store customer convenience items. Moreover, Fortuner Legenderâ€™s inside
        boasts a dual-tone black and maroon design, with contrasting stitching on the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Fortuner Legender interior includes two rear USB ports, a wireless charger, a 9-speaker
        JBL sound system, a 9-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,
        and new ambient lighting on the front door panels.
      </p>
      <h2>Exteriors</h2>
      <p>
        The exterior of the Toyota Fortuner Legender 4x4 is more fashionable and features distinctive
        design elements. It has a more streamlined upper grille, a bigger lower grille, and sharper,
        LED twin projector headlamps up front, which give the mid-size SUV a more dynamic appearance.
        A more aggressive front bumper is also present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increased sportiness is carried over to the sides with brand-new 20-inch alloy wheels with
        a silver-black two-tone finish. A new bumper has been added to the back, and it forms an L with
        the fog lamps and has vertical black blades on the ends.
      </p>
      <h2>Safety features</h2>
      <p>

        the surroundings, making parking relatively easier. It comes with 7 airbags.

        suite, which includes the Pre-Collision System (PSS), Lane Departure Alert (LDA), and Dynamic
        Radar Cruise Control.
      </p>

        and advanced features. It is based on the Toyota Fortuner, but it has a more stylish and upscale
        design. Here are some of its key features:

      </p>
      <h2>Toyota Fortune Legender price in India</h2>
      <p>
        The Toyota Legender is now offered in both 4X2 and 4X4 configurations thanks to the introduction
        of the new 4X4 model. The Fortuner Legender 2.8L turbo diesel's prices increased by as much as
        Rs. 77,000, with the 4x2 automatic option seeing the largest increase. The 4x2 automatic version
        of the Fortuner Legender 2.8L turbo diesel experienced a price increase of 1.83%, which is the

      <h2>The bottom line</h2>
      <p>
        Fortuner has proven to be one of the most durable cars on the Indian market. And the Legender
        seems to be a more viable option. It's lighter, and faster and its electronics package is more
        sophisticated and up-to-date. With the Toyota Fortuner Legender, one gets unique exterior styling
        bits, new eye-catchy cabin upholstery, and some good updates.
